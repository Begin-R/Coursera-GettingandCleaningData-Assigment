Following is the sequence of operations for the getting tidy data from the training and test dataset: 
1.  Read the data seperately 
2.  Merge the training and test data set 
3. Read the activity and label data set 
4. Change activity into descriptive labels 
5. Read the features - this is list of column names 
6. Apply the column names to the combined data set from #2 above 
7. Extract only mean and standard deviation columns from the combined data set 
8. Provide descriptive names to the columns extracted in #7 above 
9. Read the subjects data 
10. Combine acitivity, subjects and merged training and test data set (from #2) to create tidy data 
11. Create mean of all the columns except subject and activity and create a standalong tidy data set 
12. Create a text file from #11
